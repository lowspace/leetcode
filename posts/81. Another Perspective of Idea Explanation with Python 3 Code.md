# 81. Another Perspective of Idea Explanation with Python 3 Code

Binary search needs a sorted array that can provide consistent information about its order (non-decreasing or non-ascending).

In a rotated ascending array, we can easily bound the target into the left/right side by finding the 
sorting consistency of the left/right side. <sup>[1](#ft1)</sup>

In a rotate non-decreasing array, we can use the same trick if and only if the array can provide the same cues (the sorting information about the left/right part). This idea somewhat derives from the mathematics idea, if we can't find the condition, we build it.

Q: How to highlight the sorting cues?

A: By checking the equality of the first, the medium, and the last element. If the three are the same, the array doesn't provide any useful information for the algorithm to sort. **Once the three are not equal, there is somewhat a sorting in the array, and we can implement the algorithm in rotated ascending array.**

```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> bool:
        left = 0
        right = len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return True
            elif nums[left] == nums[mid] == nums[right]: # doesn't have any information about the array
                left += 1
                continue
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                # to ensure the target not in the left side
                if nums[left] <= nums[mid] or target <= nums[right]:
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid - 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                # to ensure the target not in the right side
                if nums[mid] <= nums[right] or nums[left] <= target:
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    left = mid + 1

        return False
```
