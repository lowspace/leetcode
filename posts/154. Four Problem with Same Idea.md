# Four Problem with Same Idea

Idea is to bound the target into one side (left or right side) by rules. 

+ Array with distinct elements: easy to find the consistency of the left or right side, in other words, the sorting order of one side can be easily found.
+ Array with duplication elements: conduct the conditions to find the consistency of the left or right side.

This idea derives from equality form, in an ascending sequence, if the key falls into the interval of that sequence, then we can easily find it.
