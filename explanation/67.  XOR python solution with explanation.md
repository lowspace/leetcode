class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a, b) -> str:
        x, y = int(a, 2), int(b, 2)
        while y:
            # compute the ans without carry
            answer = x ^ y
            # compute the ans with carry position only
            carry = (x & y) << 1
            x, y = answer, carry
        return bin(x)[2:]
```

`XOR` operation simplifies the binary addition into new level with O(1) time complexity:

+ `^` to obtain the bits with different value at the same position;
+ `&` to find the bits which are both `1`  at the same position;
+ `<<` to move the carry found by `&` at its corresponding position<sup>[[2]](#ft2)</sup>  <sup>[[3]](#ft3)</sup>

which means `XOR` method computes the binary value directly:

+ remaining the different value at the same position;
+ remaining the carry value the the carry position;

then add the two parts together, until the carry is 0. <sup>[[4]](#ft3)</sup>

Quick example:

```
def addBinary(a, b) -> str:
    x, y = int(a, 2), int(b, 2)
    t = 1
    while y:
        # compute the ans without carry
        answer = x ^ y
        # compute the ans with carry position only
        carry = (x & y) << 1
        print('the ans for the', t, 'time is', bin(answer)[2:])
        print('the carry for the', t, 'time is', bin(carry)[2:], '\n')
        x, y = answer, carry
        t += 1
    return bin(x)[2:]
```

`addBinary('10010', '100010')`

```
the ans for the 1 time is 110000
the carry for the 1 time is 100 

the ans for the 2 time is 110100
the carry for the 2 time is 0 

'110100'
```

Note: `0` at the beginning of a bit will be ingored by Python.
