There are many beatiful solutions, such as [@pharrellyhy](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/discuss/3404/Python-O(n)-Solution-in-96ms-(99.43)) and [@MariaMozgunova](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/discuss/791453/90-faster-and-90-less-space-%2B-explanation), these solutions are mostly to build the zigzig string by columns (add letter level by level), and few solutions mention how to build the zigzig string by rows.

My idea is treating the Zigzag string as a complex sequence based on the following observations:

```
# Example
0. 0       8         16
1. 1     7 9       15
2. 2   6   10    14
3. 3 5     11 13
4. 4       12
```

1.  `seq_1` = the difference between the first full-column (`0, 1, 2, 3, 4`) and the second full-column (`8, 9, 10, 11, 12`) is `8`, which is `2 * numRows - 2`;
2.  `seq_2 + seq_3 = seq_1`:
	+ `seq_2` = the difference between the first full-column element to its adjacent partition-column elment, such as `1 to 7, 2 to 6, 3 to 5, 11 to 13`, which is `2 * numRows - 2 * i - 2`, `i` is the index of the rows (starting from 0).
	+  `seq_3`: the difference measures the gap between partition-column element and the next full-column element, such as `7 to 9, 6 to 10, 5 to 11`, which is ` 2 * i`.

Thus,

+ the index of the first and the last row elements can be represented as `i + n * seq_1`, `n` is a non-negative integer;
+ the index of the elements in the mid rows can be represented as `i + seq_2` -> `i + seq_2 + seq_3` -> `i + seq_2 + seq_3 + seq_2` ....

```class Solution:
    def convert(self, s: str, numRows: int) -> str:
        if numRows == 1: return s
        r = ''

        for i in range(0, numRows):
            if i == 0 or i == numRows - 1:
                seq_1 = 2 * numRows - 2
                anchor = i
                while s[anchor : anchor + 1]:
                    r += s[anchor : anchor + 1]
                    anchor += seq_1
            else:
                seq_2 = 2 * numRows - 2 * i - 2
                seq_3 = 2 * i
                anchor = i
                seq = None
                while s[anchor : anchor + 1]:
                    r += s[anchor : anchor + 1]
                    if seq == seq_2:
                        seq = seq_3
                    else:
                        seq = seq_2
                    anchor += seq

        return r
```
