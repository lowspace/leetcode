A possible rotated array includes two variants:

+ a sorted array that we can implement naive bianry search in;
+ a rotated array that we need to set rules to guide the binary search.

As for the rotated array, we can easily category it as:

+ the length of the rotated part does not exceed (not greater than) the half length of the array, such as `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`;
+ the length of the roated part exceeds (greater than) the half length of the array, such as `[7, 8, 9, 1, 2]`.

In naive binary search, if the target is greater than the medium element of the array, the algorithm will automatically check the right side. While in rotated array, we should promise the target is not in the left side then the algorithm can check the right side. Thus, the key problem over here is **how to bound the target into the desired interval**, in another words, **how to determine which side the algorithm should run**.  The idea is to promise the consistency of the side (left or right). The consistency can be interpreted as the left/right side is an ascending sequence, such as `[2, 3, 4]` in `[7, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `[7, 8, 9]` in `[7, 8, 9, 1, 2]` including the medium element, and this property helps us to drop or to pick this interval, the choice depends on ur code. 

Let me elaborate it with code.

```
class Solution:
    def search(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1

        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2

            if nums[mid] == target:
                return mid
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                # to ensure the target is rigorly in the right interval
                if nums[left] < nums[mid] or target <= nums[right]:
                    # print('1.', left, mid, right)
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    # print('2.', left, mid, right)
                    right = mid - 1
            elif nums[mid] > target:
                # to ensure the target is rigorly in the left interval
                if nums[mid] < nums[right] or nums[left] <= target:
                    # print('3.', left, mid, right)
                    right = mid - 1
                else:
                    # print('4.', left, mid, right)
                    left = mid + 1

        return -1
```

When the target is greater than the `nums[mid]`, the algorithm can check the right side if the array meets one of the conditions:

1. The left side of `nums[mid]` is a consistent array or a sequence, which means `nums[left] < nums[mid] < target`. The target is rigorously greater than all elements in the left side.
2. The target can fall into the value range of the right side of `nums[mid]`, which means `nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]`, the right side is a consitent array. The target is rigorously in the `(nums[mid], nums[right]]` interval.

Why the two conditions can promise a correct movement?

I don't hava a concise answer now. From my perspective, while `target > nums[mid]`, the condtion 1 assumes the left side is a sequence and cuts this undesired part, like navie binary search does; the condition 2 assumes the right side is a sequence and picks the desired  part, like navie binary search does. This inspires me that the core of the binary search is to drop half of the data by rules.
