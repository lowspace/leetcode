    "A message containing letters from `A-Z` can be **encoded** into numbers using the following mapping:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "'A' -> \"1\"\n",
    "'B' -> \"2\"\n",
    "...\n",
    "'Z' -> \"26\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To **decode** an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back into letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, `\"11106\"` can be mapped into:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"AAJF\"` with the grouping `(1 1 10 6)`\n",
    "* `\"KJF\"` with the grouping `(11 10 6)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the grouping `(1 11 06)` is invalid because `\"06\"` cannot be mapped into `'F'` since `\"6\"` is different from `\"06\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a string `s` containing only digits, return *the **number** of ways to **decode** it*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a **32-bit** integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Input:** s = \"12\"\n",
    "**Output:** 2\n",
    "**Explanation:** \"12\" could be decoded as \"AB\" (1 2) or \"L\" (12).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Input:** s = \"226\"\n",
    "**Output:** 3\n",
    "**Explanation:** \"226\" could be decoded as \"BZ\" (2 26), \"VF\" (22 6), or \"BBF\" (2 2 6).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Input:** s = \"06\"\n",
    "**Output:** 0\n",
    "**Explanation:** \"06\" cannot be mapped to \"F\" because of the leading zero (\"6\" is different from \"06\").\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `1 <= s.length <= 100`\n",
    "* `s` contains only digits and may contain leading zero(s).\n",
