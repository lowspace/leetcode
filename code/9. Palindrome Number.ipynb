    "+ ~~the special cases or the outers should take into account at the first time. In there, the special cases are the int which ends with 0. Generally, when we need to pop sth. and push it into another container, we should consider does this push have the same/similar meaning as the pop. For example, pop a `None`, but push nothing, which will result the next container missing one placeholder or `None`; pop `0` at the end, and push `0` at the begining. In short, `0`, `None`, and other similar symbols need more attention while operating.~~\n",
